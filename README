Android Debug Bridge (adb) installation
---------------------------------------

To run android test job, adb is common to be used.

For installing adb, you can download the SDK from 
http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

By default, the SDK files are unpacked into a directory named 
android-sdk-<machine-platform>.

You can find the adb tool in <sdk>/platform-tools/.

You might want to add the location of the SDK's tools/ and platform-tools 
to your PATH environment variable, to provide easy access to the tools.
